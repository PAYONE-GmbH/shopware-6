# 4.0.0

New Features

* Shopware 6.3 support removed
* General code optimizations implemented

* Important change: The transaction data of PAYONE payments was
previously always stored in the additional fields of the orders.
Since the additional fields are stored as JSON in the database,
searching the transaction data was not very performant for large
amounts of data. Therefore, an entity extension was set up for
the transaction data so that the data is stored in an extra database
table that can be searched much more performantly. During the plugin
update, the old additional fields are migrated to the entity extension
and then the additional fields are deleted. If you have used our
additional fields in your own code or for example in the synchronization
to external systems, you have to adapt this to the new entity extension.

Bugfix

* Remove deletion of saved credit cards

Maintenance

* Remove BIC from debit
* Tested with 6.4.16

### Read transaction data ###
```
$criteria = (new Criteria())
->addAssociation(PayonePaymentOrderTransactionExtension::NAME)
->addFilter(new EqualsFilter(PayonePaymentOrderTransactionExtension::NAME . '.transactionId', $payoneTransactionId));

/** @var null|OrderTransactionEntity $transaction */
$transaction = $this->transactionRepository->search($criteria, $context)->first();

/** @var PayonePaymentOrderTransactionDataEntity $payoneTransactionData */
$payoneTransactionData = $transaction->getExtension(PayonePaymentOrderTransactionExtension::NAME);
   ```

### Update transaction data ###

```
$this->transactionRepository->upsert([[
   'id'                                         => $transaction->getId(),
   PayonePaymentOrderTransactionExtension::NAME => [
        'id' => $payoneTransactionData->getId(),
        'sequenceNumber' => 1,
        'transactionState' => 'appointed'
   ],
]], $context);
